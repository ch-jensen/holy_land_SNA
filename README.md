## Project description and data use

This project is a further extension of the PhD-project [Roles and Relations in Biblical Law](https://github.com/ch-jensen/Roles-and-Relations).

The project explores the role of the land in the biblical Holiness Code (Leviticus 17-26) within the framework of social network analysis. The linguistic data are retrieved from the [BHSA](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/) database of the Hebrew Bible with the Python package [Text-Fabric](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/index.html).
